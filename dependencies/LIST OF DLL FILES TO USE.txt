= List of DLLs needed for building (as of v0.1.1) =
I'm not going to upload the DLL files this mod depends on; sorry.
HOWEVER, here's a list of which DLLs you need to reference if you want to build it:

- `Assembly-CSharp.dll` (from `YARG_Data/Managed`)
- `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll` (also from `YARG_Data/Managed`)
- `YARG.Core.dll` (also from `YARG_Data/Managed`)
- All of the BepInEx DLLs from `BepInEx/core`
- `Unity.TextMeshPro.dll`
- `UnityEngine.dll`
- `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`
- `UnityEngine.TextRenderingModule.dll`
- `UnityEngine.UI.dll`

And I think that's all.  Maybe some of them aren't necessary, but I'm not the best at coding... lol
