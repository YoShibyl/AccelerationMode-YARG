# List of DLLs needed for building (as of v0.3.0)
I'm not going to upload the DLL files this mod depends on; sorry.
HOWEVER, here's a list of which DLLs you need to reference if you want to build it:

- All of the BepInEx DLLs from `BepInEx/core`
- `Unity.TextMeshPro.dll`
- `UnityEngine.dll`
- `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`
- `UnityEngine.TextRenderingModule.dll`
- `UnityEngine.UI.dll`

And I think that's all.  Maybe some of them aren't necessary, but I'm not the best at coding... lol
